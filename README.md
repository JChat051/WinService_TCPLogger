# WinService_TCPLogger

Description:
The TCP Traffic Logger Windows Service is a C# program designed to run as a background service on a Windows system. It serves the purpose of monitoring and logging incoming TCP traffic on a specified port. This service is especially useful for network administrators and developers who need to analyze and keep track of incoming network communications.

Features:

Port Configuration: The service can be configured to listen on a specific TCP port. This configuration can be easily adjusted through a configuration file or a user-friendly interface.

Network Traffic Monitoring: Once the service is started, it actively monitors the specified port for incoming TCP connections. It captures both the source and destination IP addresses, as well as the data exchanged during the communication.

Logging: The captured TCP traffic data is logged in a structured format, including timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and the exchanged data. The logs are typically saved in text or CSV format, making it easy to analyze and process the information.

Customization: The service can be customized to log specific types of traffic or to filter out unwanted traffic. This can be achieved by implementing filtering rules based on IP addresses, specific keywords in the data payload, or other criteria.

Error Handling: The service includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure stable operation. It can handle situations such as unexpected connection terminations, network errors, or any other issues that might arise during communication.

Security: The service can optionally implement security measures, such as encryption for the logged data or authentication mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only.
